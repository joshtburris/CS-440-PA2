It also discourages moving blocks between L2 and L7, or moving them further apart. Possibly freeing up a chance for L2 and L7 to come together sooner.

If they are sitting in opposite corners of the game board then the minimum number of moves to reach each other will be 5, which is the value of h1. With h2, the cost of L7 reaching L2 might start high but it will go down accordingly as blocks are moved out of the way. If there are no blocks in the way then the cost is 0, even if L7 or L2 still have to move to reach each other. "
